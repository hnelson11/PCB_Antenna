## Purpose:

The Half Wave Patch Antenna is used as a fourth printed circuit board creation project. 
The Half Wave Patch Antenna acts as a way to introduce radio frequency analysis and impedance characteristics with Antennas on Printed Circuit Boards.
This project utilizes an SMA connector, a 111 ohm transmission line (19 mm), and a 29.1 mm x 38.7 mm half wave patch. 


## How does it work?

The Half Wave Patch Antenna is majorly used within radio frequency (RF) and communication systems.
This type of antenna is only a few millimeters thick, which allows for implementation in cell phones, tablets, and other smart devices.
The patch is made out of a conductive copper layer and consequently fed by a microstrip transmission line. 
This patch is typically around 1/2 wavelength long, giving it the name half wave patch. 

When operating the half wave patch antenna, a signal will be fed into the microstrip transmission line.
This excites the 1/2 wavelength patch, resulting in electromagnetic waves to become radiated. 


## Connections:

Utlizing a PCB calculator,
Some ways to feed the patch antenna can be through an inset feed, through a quarter-wavelength transmission line, coaxial cable, probe feed, indirect feed, or an apeture feed.
Each way to feed into the patch antenna is dependent on the desired characteristics of the patch antenna. 
For the given design, a quarter-wavelength transmission line was chosen to feed into the antenna.
