#PCB_Antenna Layout Constraints

Length of Patch Antenna is denoted as 29.1 mm. 
Width of Patch Antenna is denoted as 38.7 mm.
Distance between edge of board and end of Antenna on opposite side of the transmission line is 11 mm. 
This length is needed for waves to better radiate through the board, to provide more accurate data collection on VNA. 
Transmission line length is 17.9 mm. 
Any SMA connector is sufficient to connect transmission line to. 
If connecting a coaxial cable from VNA to SMA, ensure the transmission line length is according to specification, and ensure a 111 ohm transmission line is created. 
Additionally, a ground plane must be created underneath Antenna Patch, and that vias are drilled near GND pins of the SMA.
This is to enusre equal current is spread throughout the board.
